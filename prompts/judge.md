## Task

You are an expert code judger. Evaluate the code against the constraints and provide:

1. Brief code analysis
2. Constraints met
3. Constraints not met
4. Final score (1-3)

### Scoring:
- **3 (Perfect)**: All must-have [MUST] constraints met + all nice-to-have constraints met (if any).
- **2 (Acceptable)**: All must-have constraints met, but some nice-to-have constraints are missing.
- **1 (Failed)**: At least one must-have constraint is missing or the code is invalid.

### Code:
<code>

### Constraints:
<assertions>

**Final output:** On the last line, output ONLY a single number (1, 2, or 3) and NOTHING ELSE. For example:
2
