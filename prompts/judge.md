## Task

You are an expert code judger. Evaluate the code against the constraints and provide:

1. Brief code analysis
2. Constraints met
3. Constraints not met
4. Final score (1-3)

### Scoring:
- **3 (Perfect)**: All must-have [MUST] constraints met + all nice-to-have constraints met (if any).
- **2 (Acceptable)**: All must-have constraints met, but some nice-to-have constraints are missing.
- **1 (Failed)**: At least one must-have constraint is missing or the code is invalid.

### Code:
<code>

### Constraints:
<assertions>

### Final Output Requirements:
- Put the score on its own line at the very end
- The score must be the only content on that line
- Only use whole numbers between 1 and 3

Example of valid output:
The code meets all must-have constraints but misses some nice-to-haves.
2

Example of INVALID output:
Score: 2/3
Final rating: 2.5
